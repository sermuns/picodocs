<em>An extremely tiny and fast alternative to MkDocs</em>
</center>

picodocs is a static site generator for documentation. It is meant to be a **lightweight**, **fast** and **batteries-included** replacement to MkDocs + [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Features

- Is installed as a single (tiny) binary. No dependencies!
- Generates static HTML that is _tiny_ and [can be free from JavaScript](about/no-javascript.md).
- Supports [Markdown extensions](about/markdown-extensions.md) like footnotes, admonitions, and more.

## Performance

picodocs is blazingly fast.
